SexyJane is a handy assistant when testing Facebook Apps with Capybara.

She opens the browser, creates a new test user, yields control to your Capybara test, and then deletes the test user when you are done.

USAGE:

require 'sexy-jane'

SexyJane::TestUser.logged_in do |user|
  // Yield begins
  visit 'http://www.facebook.com/'
  page.should have_content(user.name)
  // Yield ends
end

DETAILS:

SexyJane uses Caybara herself.

The |user| object yielded to you contains the following fields: id, access_token, login_url, email, password, name, first_name, middle_name, last_name, link, gender, locale, updated_time.

SexyJane is adament about deleting the test users she creates. The reason is beacuse Facebook limits the number of test users you can have.
