SexyJane is a ruby gem that assists with testing Facebook Apps.

In short, it creates a new test user, yields control to your test, then deletes the test user when your test completes.

USAGE:

require 'sexy-jane'

SexyJane::TestUser.logged_in do |user|
  // Yield begins
  visit 'http://www.facebook.com/'
  page.should have_content(user.name)
  // Yield ends
end

DETAILS:

SexyJane makes use of capabara to interface with the browser. When "TestUser.logged_in" is called, it opens a browser, creates a new Facebook test user, logs in as that user, and then yields control back to you, passing a test user object. This test user object contains everything you would want to know about the user, such as name, email, password, access_token etc. You could use this test user object to do selenium acceptance testing, for example.

When the forementioned yield ends, SexyJane deletes the test user it created. The reason for always deleting test users is beacuse Facebook limits the number of test users you can have at the same time.
