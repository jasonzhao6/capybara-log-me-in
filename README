SexyJane is a simple gem. It helps with testing Facebook apps. It does the following:

1. Open browser, create a new Facebook test user, and log in as that user
2. Yield to your testing code
3. At the end of yield, delete the test user it created

The syntax looks like this:

SexyJane::TestUser.logged_in do |user|
  // Your code starts here
  visit 'http://www.facebook.com/'
  page.should have_content(user.name)
  // Your code ends here
end

While yielding, SexyJane passes you a 'user' object containing email, password, first name, last email, etc.
