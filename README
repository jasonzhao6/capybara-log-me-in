SexyJane is a ruby gem that assists with testing Facebook Apps.

It opens a browser, creates a new Facebook test user, logs in as that user, and then yields control to you, passing you the test user object. The test user object contains everything about the user, such as name, email, password, access_token etc. You can use this setup to do selenium acceptance testing, for example.

USAGE:

require 'sexy-jane'

SexyJane::TestUser.logged_in do |user|
  // Yield begins
  visit 'http://www.facebook.com/'
  page.should have_content(user.name)
  // Yield ends
end

When yield ends, SexyJane deletes the test user it created. This is due to Facebook limiting the number of test users you can have at a time. SexyJane makes it easy to create new test users and deletes them for you when your test ends.
